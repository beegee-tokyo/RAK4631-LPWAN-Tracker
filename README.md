RAK4631 LoRaWan® tracker node solution![RAKwireless](./assets/RAK-Whirls.png)
===    
This code acts as a LoRaWan® tracker node. It gets location information from an attached uBlox GPS module. In addition an acceleration sensor is used to detect if the tracker is moving.
If moving of the tracker is detected, location information is sent immediately. If the tracker is stationary, the location data is sent every 1 minute

LoRaWan server required
---
In order to get this code working you need access to a LoRaWan® gateway. This could be either of    
- a public LoRaWan® gateway, like [TheThingsNetwork](https://thethingsnetwork.org/) provides in several big cities all over the world
- a private LoRaWan® gateway with multi-channel capability
- a simple and cheap single channel LoRaWan® gateway

In addition you need an account at TheThingsNetwork. You need to create an application there and register your device before the data you send over LoRa can be forwarded by the gateway. It is quite simple and there is a good tutorial at [RAKwireless RAK4270 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/Quickstart/#connecting-to-the-things-network-ttn). It is for another product of RAK, but the steps how to setup an application and how to register your device are the same. 

The region you live in defines the frequency your LoRaWan® gateways will use. So you need to setup your device to work on the correct frequency.    
##### With the new LoRaWAN® library SX126x-Arduino **V2.0.0** the region is set as a parameter in **`lmh_init()`**.

In the call **`lmh_init()`** the last parameter defines the LoRaWAN® region.    
~~The region is setup by adding a build flag into your projects platformio.ini file.~~    

Short explanation about the new **`lmh_init()`** call:    
```cpp
/**@brief Lora Initialisation
 *
 * @param callbacks   Pointer to structure containing the callback functions
 * @param lora_param  Pointer to structure containing the parameters
 * @param otaa        Choose OTAA (true) or ABP (false) activation
 * @param nodeClass   Choose node class CLASS_A, CLASS_B or CLASS_C, default to CLASS_A
 * @param region      Choose LoRaWAN region to set correct region parameters, defaults to EU868
 *
 * @retval error status
 */
	lmh_error_status lmh_init(lmh_callback_t *callbacks, lmh_param_t lora_param, bool otaa, 
	                          eDeviceClass nodeClass = CLASS_A, 
	                          LoRaMacRegion_t region = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868);
```
The first three parameters are the same as before. Two new parameters have been added.

### eDeviceClass nodeClass
Even this parameter was defined in V1.x, the **`lmh_init()`** ignored it and initialized the node **ALWAYS** as a node Class A.    
Now you can explicit set your node to **CLASS_A** or **CLASS_C**. Please take note that **CLASS_B** is still not supported by the library.

### LoRaMacRegion_t region
This parameter selects the LoRaWAN region for your application. Allowed values for the region are:    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_AS923**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_AU915**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_CN470**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_CN779**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_EU433**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_EU868**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_IN865**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_KR920**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_US915**_    
- _**LORAMAC_REGION_US915_HYBRID**_

Some explanation for the code
---

Due to the complexity of the code, it is split into functional parts.
- main.h 
   - All the includes, global definitions and forward declarations for the app
- main.cpp
   - Setup function where we initialize all peripherals
   - Main loop
   - Timers callback functions for periodic and delayed sending of packages
- acc.cpp
   - Accelerometer initialization, interrupt callback function and interrupt clearing functions
- bat.cpp
   - Battery level functions
- ble.cpp
   - BLE initialization and BLE UART callback functions
- display.cpp
   - Display initialization and handling functions
- gps.cpp
   - GPS initialization and and data poll functions
- loraHandler.cpp
   - LoRaWan initialization function, LoRaWan handling task and LoRaWan event callbacks

How to achieve power saving with nRF52 cores on Arduino IDE
----
Within the nRF52 Arduino framework is no specific function to send the MCU into sleep mode. The MCU will go into sleep mode when 
- all running tasks are calling delay()
- the running tasks are waiting for a semaphore

In this example you use the semaphore method.    

Two tasks are running independently, the loop() task and the loraTask() task which is started by the SX126x-Arduino library and runs in the background.
A semaphores are used to control the activity of the loop() tasks.    
```cpp
/** Semaphore to wake up the main loop */
SemaphoreHandle_t loopEnable;
```

After setup and starting the LoRaWan join process, the semaphore _**loopEnable**_ is taken.  
This means the loop task will go into waiting mode while the loraTask is handling LoRaWan events in the background. The LoRaWan task is in sleep mode until a LoRa event occurs.    
At this point no more task is active and the device will go into sleep mode.  
  
**Events to wake up the MCU**
1. Accelerometer detect movement
If the ACC sensor detects movement, the MCU receives an interrupt. In the interrupt callback the semaphore _**loopEnable**_ is given again, which allows the loop task to run.
2. Timer event
If the periodic sending timer is triggered, the MCU will wake up and the callback function of the timer will give the semaphore _**loopEnable**_, which allows the loop task to run.

Once the loop task is enabled, it will poll the position from the GPS module and requests sending a data package by calling sendLoRaFrame(). Then it takes the semaphore _**loopEnable**_, which puts herself back into waiting mode until the next event.
